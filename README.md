 # Containerizing the Zomato App using Docker by implementing CI/CD tool Jenkins 🚀
 ## Project Overview
In this project, we use Jenkins to build a CI/CD pipeline. This pipeline connects tools like Docker, Trivy, SonarQube, and OWASP Dependency Check all together. These tools help us check the code quality and find  any security problems before we deploy the application.
